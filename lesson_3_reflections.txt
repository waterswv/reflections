When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  If your working on a collaborative project and want to add a file quickly to share, it would make sense 
  to add it remotely on GitHub instead of keeping it local

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If you are working on a collaborative project you many not want certain changes from others in your branch prior to completing a feature. It is helpful to have control on when and where you introduce changes.
